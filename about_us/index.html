        <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top:30px;">
            Welcome to Organic Budget, an innovative way to track your transactions and budgets. The Organic Budget app is owned by a small family based in Kansas City, MO. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top:30px;">
            The idea behind the site started back in 2007 when we wanted to manage our finances. We used Excel spreadsheets to do that. It was fine then, but the process of entering the transactions started becoming cumbersome, and there was a lot of copying and pasting. Further, 
        we missed a lot of features that were not readily available in Excel.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top:30px;">
            We wanted to start a simple solution for families and individuals who would like to have control over their finances. Hence, we spent years and years to be able to formulate this idea.
            We wanted to combine simplicity, creativity, security, affordability, and performance in one solution.
        </p>
