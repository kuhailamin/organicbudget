    Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

<ul>
<li>
    <b>A data structure</b> is a particular memory arrangement of data that is suited for solving a particular problem.
    For example, <a href='./?course_id=2&lesson_index=5'>stacks</a> are based on the last-in-first-out principle (LIFO), and are suited for evaluating mathematical and undo/redo applications. 
    As another example, <a href='./?course_id=2&lesson_index=6'>queues</a> are based on the first-in-first-out principle (FIFO), and are suited for providing access in a fair manner to a shared resource.
</li>
<li>
    This course gives an overview of different linear and non-linear data structures. 
    Examples of linear data structures include vectors, linked lists, queues, etc.
    Examples of non-linear data structures include trees and graphs.
    The course also introduces various algorithms for building and operating on the different data structures we will discuss in the course.

    What are data structures used for?

    <li>
        They can be used for <b>storing data</b>, such as financial data, employee data, student data, etc. 
        The emphasis here is on quick insertion, addition, search, and deletion.
    </li> 
    <li>
        They can be used for <b>programmer's tools</b>: Data structures such as hash tables, trees, and stacks can be used
        for keeping track of variables as well as evaluating and parsing programming statements.
    </li>   
    <img class="small_picture" src="airplane.jpeg">     
     <li>
         They can be used for <b>real-world modeling</b>: We can model real-world situations with data structures. For instance, we 
         can model airline routes or road maps with graphs. The graph nodes may, for instance, represent road intersections and the edges
         may represent the weights (e.g. distances).

    What is an algorithm?
</div>
<ul>
    <img class="medium_picture no_borders" src="algorithm_illustration.jpg">
<li>
    An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that aims at solving a computational problem. Further, an algorithm typically has an input and an output. 
    For instance, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that solves the problem of sorting a set of numbers. The input is a set of unsorted numbers, and the output is the set of numbers being sorted.
</li>
<li>
    Ideally an algorithm should be correct, readable, and efficient.

    Algorithm vs. Function
</div>
<ul>
    <li><i>What is the difference between an algorithm and a function?</i></li>
    <li><b>A function </b>is an implementation of an algorithm in a certain programming language such as C++.</li>
    <li><b>An algorithm </b>is an abstract representation of a computational procedure. It is written in pseudo code. Computer scientists use 
    it so that they don't have to worry about specificities of a certain language. Software engineers can easily 
    implement an algorithm in a specific language later on.
    </li>
    <li>Unlike function code, algorithm code is not standardized. Hence, there may be many different
    ways to write the same algorithm. However, it is imperative that the algorithm code is easy to read.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes the terms "function" and "algorithm" are used interchangeably. Generally speaking, a function can also be considered an algorithm. 
    </li>
    <li> <b>Algorithm Example:</b></li>
</ul>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-c"> Input:   A[0], A[1], …, A[n-1]
 Output: arrange the n numbers such that A[0] &le; A[1] &le; … &le; A[n-1].
 Algorithm: Selection Sort
 for (i = 0, i &le; n-1, i++){	
     find j such that 
 	    A[j]= min{A[i], A[i+1], …, A[n-1]}
  	    A[i]= A[j]
 }</code>
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>C++ Function Example:</b></li></ul>
<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-cpp">void selection_sort(vector&lt;Item&gt;& A){
        for(int i=0;i &le; n-1;i++){
          int min_index=min(A);
          swap(A[i],A[min_index]);
        }
    }</code>
